# IoT-Webserver
A webserver hosted on my local network with a esp32.

Files <*.ex.cpp> are example/reference code and won't be compiled into the project, so just ignore it.

Physical setup:
![Protoboard](/images/Protoboard.jpg)

BTW, this my first time with js, css & html. I'm struggling with CSS -_-
